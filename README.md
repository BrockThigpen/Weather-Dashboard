This application allows the user to search a US city, and the current weather will be displayed. The information given to the user includes current date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

This application was created as a home work assignment for the UNCC full stack flex bootcamp. In the future i would like to add uv index to the displayed cards, as well as smaller cards displaying the 5 day forecast.
